ME:
in the assignment, since i think its impossible to store and calculate both euclidean norms of vectors a and b as well as store the dot product,
and also the dot product of each vector to itself using the euclidian norm,
am i allowed to use more floating registers?

AI ASSISTANT:
You raise an excellent point! This is a classic problem in assembly programming with limited registers. Let me analyze what you need to store and calculate:
What you need to compute:

Dot product of A·B (for numerator)
Euclidean norm of A = √(A·A)
Euclidean norm of B = √(B·B)
Final cosine similarity = (A·B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

The register constraint problem:

You only have f10 and f20 for temp operations
You only have f30 for return values
You need to store at least 3 intermediate results

The solution - You DON'T need more registers!
The key insight is that you should call procedures sequentially and use memory or the stack to store intermediate results. Here's the approach:

.data
# Reserve memory for intermediate results
dot_product_result:     .float 0.0      # Store A·B
norm_a_result:         .float 0.0      # Store ||A||
norm_b_result:         .floAnswer to your question:
No, you should NOT use more floating-point registers. The assignment constraints are intentional and designed to teach you proper memory management and procedure calling conventions.
The correct approach:

Use memory (either .data section or stack) to store intermediate results
Call procedures sequentially - don't try to do everything at once
Reuse f30 for each procedure's return value
Use f10 and f20 only for temporary calculations within each procedure

Why this works:

Each procedure does its own calculation using only f10, f20, and f30
Results are stored in memory between procedure calls
You load the stored values only when you need to combine them
The stack or data section acts as your "extended register file"

Key insight for EuclideanNorm:
For computing ||A||, you can reuse your DotProduct procedure by calling it with the same vector twice:

DotProduct(A, A) gives you A·A
Then take sqrt.s to get ||A|| = √(A·A)

This approach teaches you real-world assembly programming skills: managing limited resources and using memory effectively when registers aren't sufficient.


ME:
wait i can just use the memory? i dont know why i thought i was not allowed to not use memory


AI ASSISTANT:
Exactly! You're absolutely allowed to use memory! In fact, that's the expected and standard approach in assembly programming when you have limited registers.
You can use memory in several ways:
1. Data section (most common for intermediate results):
assembly.data
dot_product_result: .float 0.0
norm_a_result:      .float 0.0
norm_b_result:      .float 0.0
2. Stack (good for temporary storage):
assemblyaddi $sp, $sp, -12    # Make room for 3 floats
s.s  $f30, 8($sp)     # Store first result
s.s  $f30, 4($sp)     # Store second result
s.s  $f30, 0($sp)     # Store third result
3. Pre-allocated memory regions (like you're already doing for vectors):
assembly# You're already using these!
li $a0, 0x10010000    # Vector A in memory
li $a1, 0x10010040    # Vector B in memory
# Could also use 0x10010080 for intermediate results
Why you might have thought you couldn't use memory:
Many students initially think assembly programming means "registers only" because:

Registers are faster than memory
Early examples focus on register operations
The constraints mention specific registers to use

But the reality is:

Registers are for active computation
Memory is for storage when you run out of registers
This is exactly how real programs work!

The assignment expects you to use memory because:

It's impossible to do otherwise with only 3 floating-point registers
It teaches real-world skills - managing the memory hierarchy
It's the standard practice in assembly programming
Your vectors are already in memory - you're just extending this concept

So yes, go ahead and use memory freely! The register constraints are just telling you which registers to use for active calculations, not prohibiting memory usage for storage.
